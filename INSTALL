This is how a normal installation looks like:
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix) ../
> make
> make install

KioskTool also has two extra packager-configurable variables:

DEFAULT_MIN_UID
DEFAULT_MIN_GID

These serve as defaults for filtering the user and group views by UID and GID.
Set them to the values your distribution uses for newly created users and groups.

For example:
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(kde4-config --prefix) -DDEFAULT_MIN_UID=1000 -DEFAULT_MIN_GID=1000 ../
